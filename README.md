#### This is a component built in React.
##### It can be customized by changing the `propType` or attribute (for example, specify the size of the avatar by declaring xs/sm/md/lg, set the shape to a circle or square, etc.)
##### If there is a first and last name passed to the name `propType`, it will display the first and last initial in the avatar.
